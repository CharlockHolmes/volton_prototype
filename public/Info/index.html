    <p>This application was created by Charles Simon</p>
    <p>The idea behind the application is to allow the user to generate any number of customised plate and band heaters with visual feedback to then create a submission.<br>
    Many options are included in the program, however it is important to take note of the additional notes field to enter unimpemented specifications such as wire length, double circuit, intergrated TC, box connector dimentions and more.</p>
